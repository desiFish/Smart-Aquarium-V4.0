> In Sanskrit, "Mina" (मीन) represents the fish, symbolizing freedom, fluidity, and the eternal flow of life. As the twelfth and final sign of the zodiac (known as "Pisces" in Western astrology), Mina embodies adaptability and spiritual wisdom. Just as fish navigate the depths with graceful purpose, this project aims to create harmony between technology and aquatic life. The name embodies our philosophy of maintaining balance in the artificial ecosystems we create, guided by ancient wisdom yet powered by modern innovation.

## ⚠️ SAFETY WARNING ⚡

**DANGER: This project involves HIGH VOLTAGE (240V AC) which can be LETHAL!**

This project interfaces with mains electricity which poses serious risks including:
- ⚡ Electric shock
- 🔥 Fire hazard
- 💧 Water + electricity dangers

### Required Safety Measures:
1. **Circuit Protection:**
   - Install appropriate MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker)
   - Use RCCB (Residual Current Circuit Breaker) rated 30mA
   - Proper fusing for each circuit (max 6A)

2. **Grounding:**
   - All metal parts must be properly grounded
   - Use ground fault protection
   - Double-check ground connections

3. **Installation:**
   - Must be installed by qualified electrician
   - Follow local electrical codes
   - Use proper junction boxes
   - Keep high voltage components away from water

4. **Operation:**
   - Never operate with wet hands
   - Keep electronics sealed from moisture
   - Regular safety inspections
   - Disconnect power before maintenance

**DISCLAIMER:** Author (desiFish) is not responsible for any damage or injury. Proceed at your own risk.

## 🌊 Coming Soon! 
_Project under development_ 🛠️

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This project is in active development and has not been thoroughly tested. Use at your own risk.

A cutting-edge aquarium control system that will revolutionize your underwater world! 🎮 
Advanced control for aquariums using ESP32, Preference Lib. and LittleFS.

### Upcoming Features:
- ~~📟 20x4 LCD Display for on-device status~~
  ~~- Real-time relay status~~
  ~~- Current time and schedules~~
  ~~- Basic system information~~
  ~~- No WiFi required for essential monitoring~~

> Note: Since this version is using webserver, I am putting away the LCD option, since all controls are available in web server. Rather I will use 4 WS2812B RGB LEDs for simple status purpose.
> The LCD version along with buttons will feature in Smart Aquarium V4.1

- 💡 4x WS2812B RGB LEDs for status indication
  - Visual relay status indication
  - Network connection status
  - System status alerts
  - Error condition warnings

### Current Features:
- 🤜 Better Web UI
- 📱 Mobile-friendly interface
- 📊 Automatic Controls
- ⚡ Dual-core ESP32 support only (ESP32, ESP32-WROOM, etc.)

### Technical Details:
- 💾 Uses LittleFS for storing web interface files
- 💽 Preferences library for persistent settings storage
- 🕒 Real-time scheduling with DS3231 RTC
- 🌐 NTP time synchronization
- 🔌 Controls up to 4 independent relays (easily scalable)
- 🎛️ Three operating modes per relay
- 💡 State persistence across power cycles
- 📱 Mobile-first responsive interface
- ⚡ Runs on both CPU cores for reliability
- 🔄 Automatic status updates every second
- 🌍 Async web server for better performance
- 📊 JSON-based API endpoints

### Scalability Note:
- ✨ Backend code is fully scalable - just modify NUM_RELAYS and RELAY_PINS array
- 🔧 Web UI JavaScript is scalable - all functions work with any relay ID
- ⚠️ HTML components need manual duplication with correct ID numbers for additional relays
- 📍 Default pin configuration: GPIO 26, 27, 14, 12
- 🔧 Max relay count limited only by available GPIO pins

## 📱 Operating Modes

Project_Mina offers three versatile operating modes for each relay:

### 🔄 Manual Mode
Default operating mode for all relays.
1. Toggle relay ON/OFF directly through the web interface
2. State persists until manually changed
3. Ideal for direct control of equipment
4. Settings are saved and restored after power cycles

### ⏱️ Timer Mode
Temporary timed operation for specific durations.
1. Set desired duration in seconds
2. Relay automatically toggles after duration expires
3. Returns to manual mode after completion
4. Perfect for temporary operations (feeding, maintenance)
5. Timer state persists through power cycles

### 🕒 Auto Mode
Scheduled operation based on time of day.
1. Set ON time and OFF time (24-hour format, e.g., "14:30")
2. Supports both same-day schedules (ON: 09:00, OFF: 17:00)
3. Handles overnight schedules (ON: 22:00, OFF: 06:00)
4. Checks schedule every second
5. Schedule persists through power cycles

> 💡 **Tip**: For equipment that needs to run overnight, set the ON time after the OFF time
> (e.g., ON: 22:00, OFF: 06:00)
